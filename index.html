<a id="seller-setup" class="anchor" href="#seller-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Seller setup</h3>

<p>You will have to create an account for your seller &amp; also setup their payout preference on Payoneer before they can participate in an escrow transaction. During account creation, Payoneer conducts a comprehensive KYC check before approving the user to use escrow. We recommend you to add seller escrow setup to your onboarding process to eliminate RISKY sellers on your marketplace by leveraging our KYC checks for account approval.</p>

<p>Create a seller account
You can POST the partner details to accounts resource in Payoneer escrow API set to create an account for the seller. This also creates a user for that account. 
As part of account creation, we perform comprehensive KYC check on the user before enabling escrow for the user. KYC process involves checking the user against OFAC sanctioned list, etc…. [jai to update]</p>
